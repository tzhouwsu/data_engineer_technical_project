# here is a python code for this task

code_TZhou.py

## how to use it
1) it is written in python 2.7.13, and it imports json, csv, re, sys as it runs

2) no need to compile it, run it as:

  python code_TZhou.py csv-file sample-file 

     where "csv-file" is the file that contains onet-to-soc map
       and "sample-file" is the input file that contains the input objects

3) I have a test-input-file "test-inp" for testing of removing html tags

  its output is named "test-inp.out"

4) file "sample.out.gz" is a gzipped file of the output from "sample"
